# Kernel methods on cannabis microsatellite data

This project aims to apply Kernelized methods like SVM to a classification problem.

## The problem

The main task is to classify cannabis plants into two groups: _marijuana_ and _hemp_. This classification is made with [microsatellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite) data from an [open dataset](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.p2d8h).

## Notebook

In this repository it can find all the code used to develop the whole project, moreover a notebook with the results is provided. Other notebooks with the preprocess of the raw data are provided as well.

* Results notebook

* Preprocess notebook


## Work Report

As this project is part of the Machine Learning II class, we also provide the report delivered to our professor.
